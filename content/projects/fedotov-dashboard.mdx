## Overview

A full-stack web application featuring a public portfolio with MDX-based content and a protected dashboard with todo management capabilities. Serves as a training ground for Lead JavaScript Engineer skills — testing, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and microservices.

## Key Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**: NextAuth 5 with credentials provider, JWT sessions, and two roles (user/admin)
- **RBAC**: Users manage their own todos; admins have full access with user filtering
- **Todo CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete with Zod validation and server actions
- **REST API**: Full versioned API (`/api/v1/`) with pagination, search, ownership checks, and proper HTTP status codes
- **GraphQL API**: Apollo Server on `/api/graphql` with Query/Mutation support, reusing the same data layer
- **Pagination & Search**: Server-side pagination with URL-based search and debounced input
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with Tailwind CSS — dual rendering (mobile cards + desktop table)
- **Testing**: 137 unit/integration/component tests (Vitest) + 19 E2E tests (Playwright)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Lighthouse CI budgets, bundle analyzer, Web Vitals baseline

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router, React Server Components)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.7
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) via `postgres` package
- **Auth**: NextAuth 5 beta with JWT strategy
- **API**: REST (Next.js Route Handlers) + GraphQL (Apollo Server + @as-integrations/next)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library, Playwright
- **Performance**: Lighthouse CI, @next/bundle-analyzer
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier, Husky + lint-staged

## Architecture Decisions

All architectural decisions are documented as ADRs in the `docs/adr/` directory, covering project structure, data model, authentication, content management, testing strategy, E2E testing, and performance monitoring.
