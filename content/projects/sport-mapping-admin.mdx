## Overview

An administrative dashboard for managing sports data mappings within a betting platform. Operators use it to map unmapped sports entities (events, markets, outcomes, periods) to standardized definitions, manage translations, monitor feed performance, and track system activity through audit logs.

_Source code is proprietary._

- **Data Management**: CRUD for sports, categories, tournaments, competitors, widgets, and forms
- **Multi-Language Translations**: Manage entity translations across multiple locales with dynamic loading
- **Settlements & Transactions**: View and manage settlement data
- **Manual Event Operations**: Event creation, recovery, and correction tools
- **Feed Monitoring**: Track feed performance and data provider health
