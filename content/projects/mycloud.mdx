## Overview

A high-load cloud storage platform similar to Google Drive and Dropbox, built at Luxoft. The platform handles massive user-generated datasets with real-time file operations including uploads, downloads, and directory navigation.

_Source code is proprietary. Developed at Luxoft (Jul 2017 — Oct 2019)._

## Key Features

- **File Management**: Upload, download, move, rename, and delete files and folders with real-time progress tracking
- **Large File Tree Rendering**: Optimized React rendering for directories with thousands of files and high-frequency data updates
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Redux-based global state management syncing file operations across browser tabs and devices
- **Code Splitting**: Webpack build pipeline with modular development, tree-shaking, and lazy-loaded routes for fast initial page load
- **Security**: Secure token handling and protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF) for user cloud storage integrity

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React
- **State Management**: Redux (global state for real-time file operations)
- **Build**: Webpack (code splitting, tree-shaking, asset management)
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)
- **API**: RESTful APIs
- **Security**: Secure token handling, XSS/CSRF protection

## My Role

Senior Frontend Developer. Led refactoring of legacy modules into reusable React components, reducing bug rate in the core file-management module. Configured and optimized Webpack build pipelines, significantly reducing initial page load times.
